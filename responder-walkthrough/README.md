# Introduction

As part of the learning path for beginners, **Hack The Box** offers a series of machines under the Starting Point **Tier 1** category. These are designed to help new users get familiar with the fundamentals of penetration testing in a guided and progressive way. Among them, **Responder** stands out as the first machine that introduces a slightly more complex challenge. Despite its **Very Easy** difficulty rating, solving it requires chaining together a few steps â€” making it more structured than previous boxes in the path. It's a great opportunity for newcomers to practice building simple attack chains and start developing a more methodical mindset when approaching machines.
